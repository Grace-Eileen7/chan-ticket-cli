# Phase 3 CLI Project Chan Tickets CLI

A Python command-line application for managing ticket sales for the African Nations Championship (CHAN) football matches. This system prevents selling by ensuring unique seat assignments and provides a reliable management tool for both organizers and fans.

## Features

- **Dual Interface:** Separate Admin and User menus with appropriate permissions
- **Admin Capabilities:** Full CRUD operations for matches, users, and tickets
- **User Features:** Browse matches and purchase tickets with seat selection
- **Data Integrity:** Prevents duplicate ticket sales using database constraints
- **Interactive CLI:** User-friendly menus with input validation
- **Database Migrations:** Alembic-powered schema versioning

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3** with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **SQLite** database
- **Alembic** for database migrations
- **Pipenv** for dependency management
- **Click** for CLI functionality

## **Start the Application/Installation &setup**

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd chan-ticket-cli
```

2.Install dependencies from the Pipfile:

```bash
pipenv install
```

3.Activate the virtual environment

```bash
pipenv shell
```

4.Initialize the database by running Alembic migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

This creates the database tables based on the models defined in lib/db/models.py.

Running the Application

```bash
python lib/db/seed.py
```

---

## Notes

-The application is interactive and relies on user input from the command line.
-Database migrations are managed using Alembic.
-Ensure your database is set up before running CLI commands.
